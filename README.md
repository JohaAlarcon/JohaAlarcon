## 💬 About Me
Hello! I’m **Johana**, a versatile **Data Engineer** with a background in **Electronic Engineering** and extensive experience in **project management**.  
My passion lies in turning raw information into scalable, production-grade data products on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. I design serverless architectures, orchestrate complex automations, and apply NLP & AI to extract insights from massive legislative document collections.

## 🏆 Highlights

- **Cloud-Native Pipelines**: End-to-end design and deployment of data pipelines on **GCP** (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Workflows, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub & managed **PostgreSQL**) handling millions of records daily.  
- **Automation Orchestration**: Orchestrated large-scale scraping, bulk PDF downloads, OCR, and database loading using **n8n** and **Google Workflows**.  
- **OCR & AI Services**: Integrated **Tesseract** (Cloud Run) and **OpenAI** APIs for text extraction, automatic summarization, embeddings generation, and topic classification.  
- **Secure Microservices**: Built FastAPI microservices containerized with Docker, secured by **dynamic ID-tokens** (Cloud Run → Cloud Run) to enable credential-free calls from n8n & Workflows.  
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Created semantic graphs of legislative projects, authors, and topics using **text-embedding-3-small** embeddings and graph visualization libraries.  
- **Cost & Security Optimization**: Implemented fine-grained IAM, VPC connectors, and storage class tuning to cut GCP costs ~40 % while meeting compliance requirements.  
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized in large-scale processing of government & legislative documents across LATAM.
